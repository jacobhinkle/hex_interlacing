\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Foo

Motivation: optimal sampling with progressive

Briefly discuss interlaced video.

In this note, we introduce two methods akin to Adam7 for interlacing when using
hexagonal grid sampling \citep{rfc2083}.
%
These methods are simple, scale to any required depth or resolution, and can be
implemented with a series of simple rectilinear sampling grids.

\section{Background}

\subsection{The Adam7 Algorithm}

Note that although Adam7 contains 7 passes, it is trivially extended to
any number of passes.

\subsection{Wavelets and Other Methods}
\label{sec:wavelets}

Has hierarchical property and applies to hexagonal grids (c.f. Jeevan
and Krishnakumar (2014)), but doesn't work for point sampling methods
like in scanning electron microscopy modalities.


\section{Hexagonal Interlacing Algorithms}
\label{sec:hexinter}

Here we explain two methods for interlacing hexagonal grids.
%
Each method is implemented using rectilinear grids.
%
The first method (double grid interlacing) requires only shifting the grids and doubling the resolution between passes.
%
The second method requires shifting, doubling, and rotating grids.


\subsection{Basic Hex Interlacing}
\label{double-grid-interlacing}

A hexagonal grid can be constructed from two identical rectilinear grids
whose pixel spacings are a multiple of $[1, \sqrt{3}]^T$ and which are offset from one another by half that spacing (see Fig.~\ref{fig:basicphases}, Phase 1).

\begin{figure}[ht]

% trim=left bottom right top
\includegraphics[trim=140 65 115 10,clip,width=.7\textwidth]{basic_phases.pdf}
\caption{
\label{fig:basicphases} Refining a hex grid through multiple interlacing passes.
%
In each pass, previously sampled points are shown in gray.
%
Each pass consists of multiple rectilinear scans with aspect ratio $\sqrt{3}$.
}
\end{figure}

To refine a coarse hex grid with spacing $s$, we duplicate the grid shifted horizontally by $s/2$ and vertically by $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s$ using two rectilinear grids.
%
The result is a rectilinear grid whose pixel spacing is $[s/2, \sqrt{3}]^T$.
%
We then fill the gaps with a double-resolution rectilinear grid to produce the final double-resolution hex grid with spacing $[s/2, \sqrt{3}/2]^T$.
%
These steps are shown in detail in Algorithm~\ref{alg:basic}
%
We refer to one of these upscaling operations as a "phase" consisting of 3 rectilinear grids.
%
Additional phases are implemented identically, replacing $s$ with $s/2$.

\begin{algorithmic}
	\State $c \gets (0, 0)$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Rotational Hex Interlacing}
\label{triple-grid-interlacing}

Interlaced hex grids are constructed starting from a single point
located at the origin.

\subsection{Montaging}
\label{sec:montaging}

- Very simple with basic method, but no overlap. In practice you need overlap in order to register

- Rotating grid method enables overlap without doubling the dose in those regions!

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Interlaced scan patterns provide a potential for whole-FOV information early in the scan pattern.
%
This could be used in a microscopy setting to correct for sample drift, or to salvage an image that is degraded due to late-stage beam-induced damage in dose-sensitive samples.
%
Particularly for these dose-sensitive samples, optimal sampling is desired which makes the use of hexagonal grids attractive.
%
The methods we have described in this note provide practical methods for achieving interlaced hexagonal scan patterns.
%
The basic method is readily implemented and easy to handle, as it provides a square (two-grid) hexagonal pattern which is easy to process.
%
The rotating pattern is ideally suited for use in montaging schemes, due to the natural sharing of samples in the overlap regions, which avoids oversampling of the overlaps.
