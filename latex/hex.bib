abstract = {The well-known Whittaker-Kotel'nikov-Shannon sampling theorem for frequency-bandlimited functions of time is extended to functions of multidimensional arguments. It is shown that a function whose spectrum is restricted to a finite region of wave-number space may be reconstructed from its samples taken over a periodic lattice having suitably small repetition vectors. The most efficient lattice (i.e., requiring minimum sampling points per unit hypervolume) is not in general rectangular, nor is a unique reconstruction function associated with a given sampling lattice. The above results also apply to homogeneous wave-number-limited stochastic processes in the sense of a vanishing mean-square error. It is also found that, given a particular sampling lattice, the optimum (mean-square) presampling filter for nonwave-number-limited processes effects an ideal wave-number cutoff appropriate to the specified sampling lattice. Particular attention is paid to isotropic processes: minimum sampling lattices are specified up to eight-dimensional spaces, and a number of typical reconstruction functions are calculated.}

abstract = {Sampling in fluorescence microscopy is treated using the concept of the three-dimensional (3D) optical transfer function (OTF). The border of the OTF frequency surface defines the required minimum sampling. The shape of the OTF is derived from simple considerations and valid for far-field high numerical aperture, vector theory. Optimal regular sampling is achieved by a hexagonal grid in 2D, and corresponding hexagonal structures, body-centered cubic (bcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures, in 3D. As compared to standard (rectilinear grid) sampling a reduction of 13.4% in 2D and 29.3% in 3D can be achieved with optimized sampling. This reduction in data size is also accompanied by an imaging speed improvement, a reduction of sample bleaching, and can lead to imaging with better signal to noise ratio.}
